# Henry Rivera Tandem SEApprentice Challenge 2020

## Information about how to run the code
This project is meant to be run in the terminal using Python. The interpreter I used was Python 3.8
Modules I imported were **random** to mix up questions in JSON file and **JSON** to parse data in JSON file

## Known issues or complexity to be on the look out for
- When asked if you would like to play again your answer **must** be a **Y** for Yes or **N** for No

## Additional features I would like to have added to make my trivia app even more awesome
- I would really like to implement a multi-player functionality to practice with friends

## Assumptions
- A round of trivia has 10 Questions
- All questions are multiple-choice questions
- Your score does not need to update in real time
- Results can update on form submit, button click, or any interaction you choose
- We will provide you with the trivia data such as the questions, correct and incorrect answers via a JSON file.

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] A user can view questions.
- [x] Questions with their multiple choice options must be displayed one at a time.
- [x] Questions should not repeat in a round.
- [x] A user can select only 1 answer out of the 4 possible answers.
- [x] The correct answer must be revealed after a user has submitted their answer
- [x] A user can see the score they received at the end of the round
